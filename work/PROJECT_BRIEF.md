## Vision

A fast, delightful habit tracker that makes building daily routines feel like a game. Users can log habits in under 30 seconds, watch their streaks grow, and feel motivated by bold, colorful visuals that celebrate their progress.

## Problem Statement

Building new habits is hard because tracking feels like a chore. Existing apps are either too complex (requiring accounts, syncing) or too boring (plain checkboxes). Solo users need a frictionless, local-first tool that makes daily check-ins feel rewarding, not tedious.

## Target Users

**Primary**: Solo users building personal habits

User characteristics:
- Want to track 3-10 daily habits
- Value speed over features
- Motivated by visual progress (streaks, colors)
- Privacy-conscious (prefer local data)
- Use primarily on one device (phone or desktop)

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Quick Habit Check-in
Fast daily logging interface
- One-tap habit completion
- Today view as default screen
- Undo last action
- Optimistic UI (instant feedback)

### 2. Streak Tracking
Visual progress motivation
- Current streak per habit
- Best streak record
- Streak freeze (skip days without breaking)
- Visual celebration on milestones (7, 30, 100 days)

### 3. Habit Management
Basic CRUD for habits
- Create habit with name, icon, color
- Edit habit details
- Archive (not delete) habits
- Reorder habits by drag-and-drop

### 4. Progress Dashboard
Stats and motivation
- Weekly/monthly completion rates
- Habit heatmap (GitHub-style)
- Total habits completed counter
- Motivational messages

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) | Modern React, static export for PWA |
| UI | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS | Accessible, customizable, fast |
| Storage | localStorage + Dexie.js | Local-first, IndexedDB for scale |
| State | Zustand | Simple, performant client state |
| Testing | Vitest + Playwright | Fast unit tests, reliable E2E |
| Hosting | Vercel | Free tier, automatic deployments |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can add a habit in < 5 seconds
- [ ] Can complete daily check-in in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Streaks display accurately
- [ ] Works offline (PWA)
- [ ] Lighthouse performance > 90
- [ ] Zero backend dependencies

## Out of Scope (v1)

- User accounts and authentication
- Cloud sync across devices
- Social features (sharing, accountability)
- Push notifications (may add as PWA feature later)
- Habit templates/recommendations
- Advanced analytics

## Open Questions

- Should streak freeze be automatic (weekends) or manual?
- What milestone numbers trigger celebrations?
- Dark mode in v1 or v2?
